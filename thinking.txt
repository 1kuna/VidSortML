Got it, let's go through this step by step. First, I need to focus on the kill feed entries with the yellow highlight (since those are my kills). The Roman numerals (III, IV) indicate the kill count for the round, which is authoritative. 

Let's list out the yellow entries (my kills) with the Roman numerals:

- At timestamp 19.5s: "III" (so 3 kills) next to "Me" killing Evaliyyy
- Then 21.7s: "III" (3 kills) killing Osamabinclappin
- 22.5s: "IV" (4 kills) killing HubbyMadeMeGetOn

Wait, the Roman numerals reset here. Let's check the progression. 

Looking at the clip: 

- From ~0-19s, there are kill feed entries without Roman numerals (but the yellow highlights are the kills, so I need to count those yellow ones. Wait, the key is that Roman numerals (III, IV) are next to the yellow highlighted entries. So each yellow entry with a Roman numeral is part of that round. 

Wait, the problem states: "Roman numerals (if visible next to yellow entries): III=3, IV=4, V=5 (ace), VI=6, VII=7, VIII=8. Highest numeral = your kill count (this is authoritative)."

So when we see III next to a yellow entry, that's the kill count for that round. For example, at 21.7s, there's "III" and "Me" killing Osamabinclappin, and "IV" at 22.5s for HubbyMadeMeGetOn. Wait, no: in the 21.7s frame, it's two entries: "III" (Me vs Evaliyyy) and "III" (Me vs Osamabinclappin)? Wait, no, let's check the frames carefully.

Let's go frame by frame (timestamps as given):

<17.5 seconds>: No yellow entries.

<18.5 seconds>: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow, so kill) but no Roman numeral visible.

<19.5 seconds>: "III" next to Me killing Evaliyyy (so Roman numeral III here, meaning 3 kills so far in this round).

<20.5 seconds>: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) but Roman numeral still III.

<21.5 seconds>: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → but wait, it's "III" next to Me killing Osamabinclappin.

<22.5 seconds>: "IV" next to Me killing HubbyMadeMeGetOn (so Roman numeral IV, meaning 4 kills in this round).

So the kill feed progression for yellow entries (my kills) is:

1. Me vs Evaliyyy (timestamp ~18.5s)
2. Me vs Osamabinclappin (timestamp ~20.5s)
3. Me vs Osamabinclappin again? Wait, no, let's check the exact frames.

Wait, in the <19.5s frame: "III Me vs Evaliyyy" → so that's the 3rd kill? Wait, no, the Roman numeral III is the kill count. So when you see III, it's 3 kills in the round. So for example, the first kill in a round would have Roman numeral I, but maybe it's not visible. But in this clip, the Roman numerals are III and IV.

Looking at the <19.5s frame: "III Me vs Evaliyyy". So that's the 3rd kill in the round. Wait, no: if the kill count is 3, then there are 3 kills in that round. So the Roman numeral III means this is the 3rd kill in the round.

Then, <20.5s: "III Me vs Osamabinclappin" → wait, no, let's check the specific frame:

<19.5 seconds> (frame 2): "III Me vs Evaliyyy" → so that's the 3rd kill.

<20.5 seconds> (frame 3): "III Me vs Osamabinclappin" → maybe another kill, but it's still 3? Wait, no, the Roman numeral is the kill count for the round, not per entry. Wait, the description says: "Roman numerals (if visible next to yellow entries): III=3, IV=4, V=5 (ace), VI=6, VII=7, VIII=8. Highest numeral = your kill count (this is authoritative)."

Ah, so the highest Roman numeral in the visible entries is the kill count for that round. So if there's a III and then a IV, the IV is higher, so the kill count is 4.

Let's list all yellow entries (my kills) and see which Roman numerals are present:

- At ~19.5s: III (Me vs Evaliyyy) → so 3 kills so far.
- At ~20.5s: III (Me vs Osamabinclappin) → but is this the same round? 
- At ~21.5s: III (Me vs Osamabinclappin again?) → no, the text says "Osamabinclappin" twice, but maybe it's a different kill.
- At ~22.5s: IV (Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn) → Roman numeral IV, so kill count is 4.

Wait, but in the <22.5s frame: "IV" is next to the yellow "Me" kill. So the Roman numeral IV means that this is the 4th kill in the round. Therefore, the kill count for the round is 4.

Now, let's check if there's a reset. The problem states: "Roman numeral RESET (saw IV, then later I or II) → definite new round". But here, we have III and then IV. So it's a single round where the kill count goes from 3 to 4. That makes sense.

Now, let's count the yellow entries (my kills):

- Evaliyyy (first yellow kill)
- Osamabinclappin (second yellow kill)
- Osamabinclappin again? Wait, no, in the <20.5s frame, it's "Me vs Osamabinclappin", but maybe it's the same victim. The problem states: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)".

So if Osamabinclappin is killed twice, it's still 1 kill. But wait, does the victim appear multiple times? Let's check:

- <18.5s>: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow, so kill)
- <19.5s>: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow, but is this a different kill? Wait, no, if the victim is the same, it's 1 kill. But the problem says "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)".

Wait, but in the kill feed, the same victim will show up multiple times as the kill feed persists for ~3 seconds. So if you kill a victim, the kill feed entry stays for 3 seconds, so you might see multiple entries for the same victim.

But the key here is the Roman numeral. The highest numeral is the kill count, so IV=4. Let's see the kill feed entries:

Looking at the timestamps:

<19.5s: "III Me vs Evaliyyy" → so 3rd kill is Evaliyyy.

<20.5s: "III Me vs Osamabinclappin" → 3rd kill is Osamabinclappin?

Wait, no, the Roman numeral is the kill count for the round, not the entry. So if you have three kills in the round, the numeral is III, then when you have four kills, it's IV.

So let's track the kill count:

- Entry 1: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → kill 1
- Entry 2: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → kill 2
- Entry 3: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → but if it's the same victim, it's still kill 2? No, the victim is the same, so it's 1 kill. Wait, but in the kill feed, the same victim will show up multiple times as the entry persists.

Wait, the problem says: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)". So if you see the same victim multiple times in the kill feed (yellow entries), it's still 1 kill.

But when the Roman numeral is III, that's 3 kills in total. So the 3rd kill is the third victim.

Let's list all yellow entries (my kills) with their victims:

- <18.5s>: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow)
- <19.5s>: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → same victim, so 1 kill for Evaliyyy
- <20.5s>: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow)
- <21.5s>: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → same victim, so 1 kill for Osamabinclappin
- <22.5s>: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → new victim

Wait, but the Roman numeral at <19.5s is III, which is the total kill count for the round. So III=3 kills.

So let's count the victims with yellow entries:

1. Evaliyyy (appears at ~18.5s and ~19.5s) → 1 kill
2. Osamabinclappin (appears at ~20.5s and ~21.5s) → 1 kill
3. HubbyMadeMeGetOn (appears at ~22.5s) → 1 kill

Wait, but that's 3 kills, but the Roman numeral is IV (4). Wait, maybe I missed a kill.

Wait, let's check the frames again:

<19.5s: "III Me vs Evaliyyy" → so that's the 3rd kill. So the kill count is 3.

<21.5s: "III Me vs Osamabinclappin" → but this is the 3rd kill?

<22.5s: "IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn" → this is the 4th kill.

Ah, so the kill count goes from 3 to 4. So the 4th kill is HubbyMadeMeGetOn.

Now, let's count all yellow entries (my kills):

1. Evaliyyy (kill 1)
2. Osamabinclappin (kill 2)
3. Osamabinclappin (kill 3? But same victim, so it's still 2 victims)
Wait, no: the problem says "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)". So if the same victim is killed multiple times, it's still 1 kill. But in this case, Osamabinclappin is killed in two consecutive frames (entries), so it's one kill.

So the victims are:

- Evaliyyy (1 kill)
- Osamabinclappin (1 kill)
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (1 kill)

That's 3 victims, but the Roman numeral is IV=4. Wait, maybe there's another kill.

Wait, let's check <20.5s and <21.5s: Osamabinclappin is shown again. But is there another victim?

Wait, in <19.5s: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow)
In <20.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow)
In <21.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → same victim, so that's the same kill.
In <22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow)

So that's 3 kills: Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn.

But the Roman numeral is IV, which is 4. So where's the 4th kill?

Ah, maybe there's another kill between 19.5s and 22.5s that I missed.

Wait, let's look at the frames:

<18.5s: No kill feed, but the kill feed is the yellow entries. Wait, in <18.5s, there's a "Me vs Evaliyyy" but the frame says <17.5s is empty, <18.5s: "Me vs Evaliyyy" (yellow). Then <19.5s: "III Me vs Evaliyyy", which is the same kill, but with Roman numeral III.

Wait, the Roman numeral III means that this round has 3 kills so far. So the 3rd kill is Evaliyyy. Then the next kill is Osamabinclappin (4th? No, III is 3, so 3 kills, then IV is 4, so 4th kill).

Wait, the Roman numeral is the kill count for the round. So when it's III, that's 3 kills in the round. Then when it becomes IV, that's 4 kills in the round.

So let's track:

- First kill: Evaliyyy (kill 1)
- Second kill: Osamabinclappin (kill 2)
- Third kill: Osamabinclappin (same victim, so still kill 2? No, the problem says "same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill", so each distinct victim is 1 kill.

Ah! Important: each unique victim counts as 1 kill, even if multiple entries. So if you kill the same victim twice in the same round, it's still 1 kill. But in this case, are they the same victim?

Wait, Osamabinclappin is the victim in two entries: <20.5s and <21.5s. So it's one kill for Osamabinclappin.

So let's list all unique victims with yellow entries:

1. Evaliyyy (appears in <18.5s and <19.5s)
2. Osamabinclappin (appears in <20.5s and <21.5s)
3. HubbyMadeMeGetOn (appears in <22.5s)

That's 3 unique victims, but the Roman numeral is IV, which is 4. So there must be a 4th unique victim.

Wait, maybe I missed a kill. Let's check again:

<18.5s: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow)
<19.5s: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → same victim, same kill.
<20.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow)
<21.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → same victim, same kill.
<22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow)
<23.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → same victim, same kill.

Wait, but the Roman numeral at <19.5s is III, so that's 3 kills. So the 3rd kill must be a different victim.

Wait, maybe there's a victim that I missed. Let's look at the frames:

At <17.5s, the kill feed is empty. Then <18.5s: Me vs Evaliyyy. Then <19.5s: III Me vs Evaliyyy. Then <20.5s: III Me vs Osamabinclappin. Then <21.5s: III Me vs Osamabinclappin. Then <22.5s: IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn. Then <23.5s: IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn.

Wait, but III is 3 kills, IV is 4 kills. So the 4th kill is HubbyMadeMeGetOn. So where are the 3 kills before that?

Kill 1: Evaliyyy
Kill 2: Osamabinclappin
Kill 3: Another victim?

Wait, maybe there's a victim that's killed but not visible. No, we have to count all yellow entries with victims.

Wait, perhaps the Osamabinclappin kill is the 3rd kill, and then HubbyMadeMeGetOn is the 4th.

Wait, let's count the number of yellow entries (each yellow entry is a kill, but same victim counts as 1 kill).

But the problem says: "Count only yellow-highlighted entries" and "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)".

So for each unique victim, count 1, even if multiple entries.

So let's list unique victims in yellow entries:

- Evaliyyy (entries: ~18.5s, ~19.5s) → 1
- Osamabinclappin (entries: ~20.5s, ~21.5s) → 1
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (entries: ~22.5s, ~23.5s) → 1

That's 3 unique victims. But the Roman numeral is IV=4. So where's the 4th?

Ah, maybe there's another victim. Let's check other frames.

Wait, at <5.0s, there's a kill feed: "Evaliyy" (no, maybe "Evaliyy" is the victim), but the kill feed is the player who killed. Wait, no: the kill feed is "Killer (weapon) vs Victim".

Wait, in the problem statement, it's "Me" (the player), so the kill feed is "Me vs Victim".

Looking at frame <4.0s: "Evaliyy vs DragonSlayer7" → but that's not my kill (no yellow highlight).

Frame <5.0s: "Evaliyy vs DragonSlayer7" → red and green, not yellow.

Frame <6.0s: "Evaliyy vs DragonSlayer7" → red and green, not yellow.

Frame <7.0s: "Osamabinclappin vs Clove" → red and green, not yellow.

Frame <8.0s: "Osamabinclappin vs Clove" → red and green, not yellow.

So all the yellow entries (my kills) are the ones with "Me" in yellow. Let's list all frames with yellow "Me":

- <1.0s: No yellow (just sword vs evil)
- <2.5s: "Me vs TAKIS" (yellow)
- <4.0s: "Me vs TAKIS" (yellow)
- <5.0s: "Evaliyy vs DragonSlayer7" (red, not yellow)
- <6.0s: "Evaliyy vs DragonSlayer7" (red, not yellow)
- <7.0s: "Osamabinclappin vs Clove" (red, not yellow)
- <8.0s: "Osamabinclappin vs Clove" (red, not yellow)
- <10.0s: No yellow
- <12.0s: No yellow
- <15.0s: No yellow
- <17.0s: "Me vs Evaliyyy" (yellow)
- <19.0s: "III Me vs Evaliyyy" (yellow)
- <20.0s: "III Me vs Osamabinclappin" (yellow)
- <21.0s: "III Me vs Osamabinclappin" (yellow)
- <22.0s: "IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn" (yellow)
- <23.0s: "IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn" (yellow)
- <25.0s: "Me vs sword" (yellow)
- <27.0s: No yellow
- <28.0s: No yellow
- <29.0s: No yellow
- <30.0s: "Me vs sword" (yellow)

Ah! Here's the key. I missed the earlier yellow entries. Let's list all yellow "Me" entries, even if they're before the Roman numerals.

Looking at the frames:

- <2.5s: Me vs TAKIS (yellow) → kill 1
- <4.0s: Me vs TAKIS (yellow) → same victim, so still kill 1 for TAKIS
- <17.0s: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → kill 2 (new victim)
- <19.0s: III Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → kill 3 (same victim)
- <20.0s: III Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → kill 4 (new victim)
- <21.0s: III Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → same victim, kill 4
- <22.0s: IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → kill 5 (new victim)
- <23.0s: IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → same victim, kill 5
- <25.0s: Me vs sword (yellow) → kill 6 (new victim)
- <30.0s: Me vs sword (yellow) → same victim, kill 6

Wait, but the Roman numerals are III and IV, which are 3 and 4. But there's a gap in the kill feed. The Roman numerals are for the round. So the Roman numeral indicates the kill count for the current round.

Wait, the problem states: "Roman numerals (if visible next to yellow entries): III=3, IV=4, V=5 (ace), VI=6, VII=7, VIII=8. Highest numeral = your kill count (this is authoritative)."

So when the Roman numeral is III, it's the kill count for the round (so 3 kills in the round). Then when it becomes IV, it's 4 kills in the round.

But let's check the timestamps where Roman numerals appear:

- <19.5s: III → 3 kills in round
- <22.5s: IV → 4 kills in round

So the round that has the Roman numeral IV has 4 kills.

Now, let's find the kill feed entries during the time when the Roman numeral is IV (which is after the Roman numeral III).

The Roman numeral III is visible at <19.5s to <21.5s, and then IV at <22.5s onwards.

So the kills during the IV round are:

- <22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow)
- <23.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → same victim
- <24.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → same victim (but Roman numeral is IV, so it's the 4th kill)
- <25.5s: Me vs sword (yellow) → new victim? Wait, but if Roman numeral is IV, then there are 4 kills.

Wait, but the Roman numeral IV means 4 kills in the round. So the 4th kill is the last one.

Let's list all yellow entries (my kills) with the Roman numeral:

- <22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow, IV) → kill 4
- <23.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow, IV) → same victim, so this is still kill 4
- <24.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow, IV) → same victim
- <25.5s: Me vs sword (yellow, IV?) → no, but is the Roman numeral still IV?

Wait, the Roman numeral is only visible at <22.5s, and then in <23.5s it's still IV.

Wait, in the problem statement, the Roman numerals are visible next to yellow entries. So in the frame where the Roman numeral is present, it's the kill count.

So for the round with Roman numeral IV, there are 4 kills.

Now, let's check the victims:

- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (appears in <22.5s, <23.5s, <24.5s) → 1 kill
- sword (appears in <25.5s) → 1 kill

Wait, but that's 2 kills, not 4. This is confusing.

Ah, maybe the Roman numeral III and IV are for the same round. The round is the sequence of kills.

Wait, let's count all yellow entries that are part of the round where Roman numeral is present.

The key is to check the rounds. The problem says that the clip spans multiple rounds. Let's check for multi-round detection.

The clip is 33.3s. Let's look for Roman numeral resets.

- At <19.5s, there's III
- Then at <22.5s, IV
- So no reset (since III to IV is increasing, not resetting to I or II).

Now, if there's more than 8 kills total, but max per round is ~8, so 8 kills could be one round.

But the problem says: "If you see 4 kills, then a gap, then 1 kill → count the 4 (focused round)".

In this clip, let's see the kill feed sequence:

- Initial yellow kills: <2.5s: TAKIS (kill 1), <4.0s: TAKIS (kill 1)
- Then <17.0s: Evaliyyy (kill 2)
- Then <19.5s: Evaliyyy (kill 3, III)
- Then <20.5s: Osamabinclappin (kill 4, III)
- Then <21.5s: Osamabinclappin (kill 4)
- Then <22.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 5, IV)
- Then <23.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 5)
- Then <25.5s: sword (kill 6)
- Then <30.0s: sword (kill 6)

But the Roman numerals (III and IV) are authoritative for the kill count in the round. So when we see III, that's 3 kills in the round. When we see IV, that's 4 kills in the round.

Wait, maybe the initial kills (TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin) are in the same round as HubbyMadeMeGetOn.

Wait, let's check the victims for the round where Roman numeral is III and IV.

- <19.5s: Evaliyyy (3rd kill)
- <20.5s: Osamabinclappin (4th kill)
- <21.5s: Osamabinclappin (4th kill)
- <22.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (5th kill)
- <23.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (5th kill)
- <25.5s: sword (6th kill)

But the Roman numeral IV is 4 kills, so maybe the 4th kill is HubbyMadeMeGetOn, and the 5th is sword.

But the highest Roman numeral is IV, so kill count is 4.

So the round that has Roman numeral IV has 4 kills.

Now, let's check the victims in the IV round:

- <22.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (1)
- <23.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (1)
- <24.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (1)
- <25.5s: sword (2)

Wait, that's 2 kills, but Roman numeral is IV. So where's the other two?

Ah, maybe the Osamabinclappin kill is also part of the IV round.

Wait, let's list all yellow entries in the time range where the Roman numeral is IV:

- <22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (IV)
- <23.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (IV)
- <24.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (IV)
- <25.5s: Me vs sword (IV)

That's 4 yellow entries (counting each entry, not unique victims). But the problem says "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)".

Wait, but the problem also says "Count only yellow-highlighted entries", which are all kill feed entries with yellow, regardless of victim. But the instruction says "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill". So if the same victim appears in multiple entries, it's still 1 kill.

So for the IV round:

- HubbyMadeMeGetOn appears 3 times (entries), so 1 kill
- sword appears 1 time (entries), so 1 kill
- Total 2 kills.

But IV is 4, so this is inconsistent.

Wait, maybe the Roman numeral is the kill count for the player's kills, regardless of victims. So if the Roman numeral is IV, it's 4 kills, even if some are same victims.

But the problem states: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)" → so the count is per unique victim.

But the Roman numeral is the actual kill count (counting each kill, not unique victims). Wait, no: in Valorant, when you kill a player, it's a kill. Even if you kill the same player multiple times, it's multiple kills. But in Valorant, you can't kill the same player multiple times in a single round. Wait, no: because of resurrection abilities.

Wait, the problem states: "Resurrection abilities (same player CAN die twice in ONE round)". So you can kill a player twice in a round (e.g., Phoenix dies, respawns, you kill them again).

Ah! So if you kill the same player twice in a round, it's two kills.

So "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill" is not correct. Wait, the problem says: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)". But with resurrection abilities, you can have the same victim killed multiple times in a round.

Wait, let's clarify: In Valorant, if a player is killed, they can revive. So if you kill a player, they die, then they revive (via Phoenix ult, Sage rez, etc.), and you kill them again. So that's two kills for the same victim in the same round.

So "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill" is incorrect. The correct rule is: Each kill entry is a kill, even if the same victim is killed multiple times in the same round.

But the problem states: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)". Wait, this might be a mistake, or it's referring to the fact that the kill feed entry persists for ~3 seconds, so multiple entries for the same kill are shown. So if you kill a player once, the kill feed entry stays for 3 seconds. So you might see multiple entries for the same victim.

But the problem says: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill", which means it's 1 kill regardless of how many entries. But in reality, in Valorant, you can kill the same player multiple times in a round, so it's multiple kills.

Wait, the problem's instructions: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)". So for the purpose of this problem, even if you see multiple entries for the same victim, it's 1 kill.

But in Valorant, resurrection abilities mean you can kill the same player multiple times in a round, so it's multiple kills.

This is conflicting. Let's read the problem statement again:

"Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)"

Ah, this is a key point: the problem defines that even if the same victim appears multiple times in the kill feed (entries), it's considered 1 kill. So it's counting unique victims, not entries.

But then, the Roman numerals are the actual kill count (number of kills), which is different.

Wait, no, the problem says: "Roman numerals (if visible next to yellow entries): III=3, IV=4, V=5 (ace), VI=6, VII=7, VIII=8. Highest numeral = your kill count (this is authoritative)."

So the Roman numeral is the kill count (number of kills, counting each kill), not unique victims.

But the problem also says: "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)". This is confusing.

Let's clarify with the problem statement:

- "YOUR kills have a YELLOW highlight on the left side of the row"
- "Same victim in multiple frames = 1 kill (entries persist ~3 seconds)" → this means that for each kill feed entry (each kill), if the victim is the same as a previous entry, it's not a new kill (i.e., multiple entries for the same victim are considered 1 kill).

But in reality, with resurrection abilities, you can have the same victim killed multiple times, so it's multiple kills. But the problem's instruction overrides this: they say to treat same victim multiple entries as 1 kill.

So for the purpose of this problem, unique victims count as 1 kill each.

But then the Roman numeral is the kill count, which is the number of unique victims.

So if Roman numeral is IV=4, that means 4 unique victims.

Let's look at the kill feed entries where yellow is present (my kills) and count unique victims:

- <2.5s: Me vs TAKIS (victim: TAKIS)
- <4.0s: Me vs TAKIS (same victim, count 1)
- <17.0s: Me vs Evaliyyy (victim: Evaliyyy)
- <19.5s: Me vs Evaliyyy (same victim, count 2)
- <20.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (victim: Osamabinclappin)
- <21.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (same victim, count 3)
- <22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (victim: HubbyMadeMeGetOn)
- <23.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (same victim, count 4)
- <25.5s: Me vs sword (victim: sword)
- <30.0s: Me vs sword (same victim, count 5)

But the Roman numeral is IV=4, which suggests 4 kills.

So the first 4 unique victims are TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn.

Then sword is the 5th.

But the Roman numeral IV=4, so the kill count is 4.

Now, let's check the timing of the Roman numeral.

The Roman numeral III appears at <19.5s, which is 3 kills (TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin).

Then IV appears at <22.5s, which is 4 kills (TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn).

Yes, that makes sense.

So the round where the Roman numeral is IV has 4 kills:

- TAKIS
- Evaliyyy
- Osamabinclappin
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn

Now, let's check the victims in the focused round.

The problem says: "If you see 1 kill, then a gap, then 3+ kills → count the 3+ (focused round)". Here, the 3+ kills (4) are in the round with Roman numeral IV.

The key is that the Roman numeral IV is the highest numeral, so the kill count is 4.

Now, let's confirm if this is the focused round.

The clip spans multiple rounds? Let's check the total kill count:

- The first part of the clip: TAKIS (kill 1), Evaliyyy (kill 2), Osamabinclappin (kill 3) → round 1, 3 kills (Roman numeral III)
- Then the next part: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 4) → round 2, 4 kills (Roman numeral IV)

But the problem says: "Count the round that occupies the MAJORITY of the clip duration".

The clip is 33.3s. Let's estimate the duration of each round:

- Round 1: From start to when Roman numeral III is present (up to ~21.5s) → ~21.5s
- Round 2: From when Roman numeral IV starts (22.5s) to end → ~10.8s

Round 1 is longer, but the problem says to count the round with the highest numeral (IV=4) since it's the current round.

Wait, the problem states: "If you see 1 kill, then a gap, then 3+ kills → count the 3+ (focused round)". Here, we have 3 kills (III) followed by 4 kills (IV). The IV round has more kills, so it's the focused round.

But the problem says: "which round to count (if multiple detected) - Count the round that occupies the MAJORITY of the clip duration". Round 1 is longer (21.5s vs 10.8s), but the problem also says "Roman numerals at clip edge tell true count even if earlier kills off-screen".

Wait, let's check the Roman numerals:

- The clip starts with no Roman numeral.
- Then, at ~19.5s, Roman numeral III appears.
- Then, at ~22.5s, Roman numeral IV appears.

This suggests that the round with Roman numeral IV is the focused round, and it's the current round.

The problem also says: "Roman numeral RESET (saw IV, then later I or II) → definite new round". Here, we see IV and then no reset (since it's the end of the clip).

The problem says: "Tiebreaker: prefer the later round".

The later round is IV.

But let's check the kill feed for the focused round.

The round with Roman numeral IV has 4 kills, as the Roman numeral is IV.

Now, the victims are:

- TAKIS (kill 1)
- Evaliyyy (kill 2)
- Osamabinclappin (kill 3)
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 4)

Wait, but are all these victims in the same round?

Yes, because the Roman numeral III and IV are sequential (3 → 4 kills), so they're in the same round (resurrection abilities allow the same player to die multiple times, but in this case, different victims).

Wait, but can you kill TAKIS and then Evaliyyy and Osamabinclappin in the same round? Yes, unless the round is over.

In Valorant, a round ends when all players are down on one team.

The kill feed entries are all in the same round if they're within the same round duration.

But the problem states: "Resurrection abilities (same player CAN die twice in ONE round)". So multiple kills on the same player are possible.

But in this case, the victims are different:

- TAKIS (kill 1)
- Evaliyyy (kill 2)
- Osamabinclappin (kill 3)
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 4)

All different victims, so 4 kills.

Now, let's check the kill feed entries with yellow highlight (my kills) and Roman numerals:

- <2.5s: Me vs TAKIS (yellow) → kill 1
- <4.0s: Me vs TAKIS (yellow) → same victim, kill 1
- <17.0s: Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → kill 2
- <19.5s: III Me vs Evaliyyy (yellow) → kill 3
- <20.5s: III Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → kill 4
- <21.5s: III Me vs Osamabinclappin (yellow) → same victim, kill 4
- <22.5s: IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → kill 5
- <23.5s: IV Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (yellow) → same victim, kill 5

But the Roman numeral IV is 4, so maybe the kill count is 4, not 5.

This is confusing.

Let's go back to the problem's instructions: "Highest numeral = your kill count (this is authoritative)".

If there's an IV, the kill count is 4, regardless of the entries.

So even if there are 5 entries, the Roman numeral IV means 4 kills.

So the victims are the first 4 unique victims.

Looking at the yellow entries:

- TAKIS (1)
- Evaliyyy (2)
- Osamabinclappin (3)
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (4)

Yes, that's 4.

Now, let's check if there are other victims in the focused round.

The focused round is the one with the Roman numeral IV, which is the round with the highest kill count.

The problem says to count the round that occupies the majority of the clip duration. The Roman numeral IV starts at ~22.5s, and the clip is 33.3s. So the part after 22.5s is ~10.8s, and before that is ~21.5s. So the first part is longer. But the problem says: "Roman numerals at clip edge tell true count even if earlier kills off-screen". So the Roman numeral is the true count for that round.

The key is that the highest numeral is IV=4, so the kill count is 4.

Now, the victims:

- TAKIS (first kill)
- Evaliyyy (second kill)
- Osamabinclappin (third kill)
- HubbyMadeMeGetOn (fourth kill)

Yes.

Let's confirm with the frames:

- <2.5s: Me vs TAKIS (kill 1)
- <17.0s: Me vs Evaliyyy (kill 2)
- <20.5s: Me vs Osamabinclappin (kill 3)
- <22.5s: Me vs HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 4)

The Roman numeral III appears at <19.5s (3 kills), and IV at <22.5s (4 kills), so the 4th kill is HubbyMadeMeGetOn.

Therefore, KILLS: 4

VICTIMS: TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn

Wait, but let's check if the TAKIS kill is in the same round as the others.

The TAKIS kill happens at <2.5s, then there's a gap, then Evaliyyy at <17.0s. If there's a gap, it might be a new round.

But the problem says: "MULTI-ROUND DETECTION: Clips may span multiple rounds. RELIABLE boundary signals: 1. Roman numeral RESET (saw IV, then later I or II) → definite new round 2. More than 8 kills total → definitely multi-round 3. ACE (V) + gap + kills on NEW victims → likely new round"

In this clip, there's no ACE (V), no Roman numeral reset (III to IV is increasing), no gap with new victims. The TAKIS kill is at the start, then a gap, then Evaliyyy, etc.

But the problem states that the Roman numeral IV is authoritative for the kill count in that round.

The kill feed entries with yellow:

- <2.5s: TAKIS (kill 1)
- <4.0s: TAKIS (same, kill 1)
- <17.0s: Evaliyyy (kill 2)
- <19.5s: Evaliyyy (same, kill 2)
- <20.5s: Osamabinclappin (kill 3)
- <21.5s: Osamabinclappin (same, kill 3)
- <22.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (kill 4)
- <23.5s: HubbyMadeMeGetOn (same, kill 4)

So there are 4 unique victims (TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn), which matches the Roman numeral IV=4.

The key is that the Roman numeral IV is the kill count, which is the number of unique victims.

Therefore:

KILLS: 4

VICTIMS: TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn
</think>

KILLS: 4
VICTIMS: TAKIS, Evaliyyy, Osamabinclappin, HubbyMadeMeGetOn

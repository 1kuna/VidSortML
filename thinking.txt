So, let's analyze the clip. First, I need to find the player's name. The first-person view shows the player's actions. Let's check the kill feed and the player's perspective.

Looking at the kill feed entries:

- In frame 1, maybe? Wait, let's check the kill feed messages. The kill feed is in the top-right. Let's go step by step.

The player's kill feed entries: When the player kills someone, their name will be on the left of the weapon icon, and the victim on the right.

First, check the frames:

Frame 3: "Evilv" eliminated someone. Wait, the player's name? Let's see the first-person view. The player is using a weapon, and when they kill, the kill feed shows.

Looking at the kill feed:

- Frame 2: "Me" (player) with "Takis" as victim? Wait, the top-right has [Me] [icon] [Takis] — but that's the player's team info, not kill feed.

Wait, the kill feed is the messages like "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — but that's a broadcast. The actual kill feed entries are the ones where a name is killed.

Let's check the kill feed entries (the ones that say "Killed by [name]").

Looking at the frames:

Frame 2: There's a kill feed entry "Evilv eliminated Takis" — but the player might be "Evilv"? Wait, no. Wait, the first-person view: the player's name is visible as "Me" in the top-right, but the kill feed is when someone is killed.

Wait, let's look at the kill feed messages:

In frame 1: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so Evilv is the killer, Takis is victim.

Frame 3: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — that's a broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 4: "Evilv eliminated Takis" again? Wait, no. Wait, the kill feed is the entries where a player is killed.

Wait, the player's name is the one in the first-person view. Let's see when the player (first-person) kills someone.

In frame 1: The player is moving. Then frame 2: The player shoots, and there's a kill feed entry "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so the player is "Evilv"? Wait, the top-right shows [Me] with the name "Evilv".

Wait, in the top-right corner, the player's name is displayed as "Me" with the name of the character. For example, in frame 1, "Me" is next to "Takis" — no, in frame 1: "Me" (player) with weapon icon, then "Takis" (team). Wait, the top-right has two teams: one is "Me" (the player's team) with names, and the other is the enemy team.

Wait, the kill feed is the messages that pop up when a player is killed. Let's look at the kill feed entries:

Frame 2: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so Evilv is killer, Takis is victim.

Frame 3: "Evilv eliminated Takis" again? No, maybe not.

Wait, in frame 19: "Me eliminated Osamabincplapin" — let's check.

Looking at frame 19: The top-right kill feed shows "Me" [weapon icon] "Osamabincplapin" — so that's a kill. The player (Me) killed Osamabincplapin.

Then frame 20: Another kill? Let's check.

Wait, the kill feed entries:

- In frame 2: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — but is the player Evilv? Because in the top-right, the player's name is "Me", which is the player's character name. So the player is "Me", but the name on the top-right is "Me" with the character's name. Wait, no — the name in the top-right is the player's in-game name. For example, when the player is playing, their name is displayed as "Me" or their actual name.

Wait, in the first frame, top-right: [Me] (with a name), then the enemy team. The player's name is "Me", but actually, it's their in-game name. Let's check when the player kills someone.

Looking at the kill feed:

- At frame 19, the kill feed shows "Me" [weapon icon] "Osamabincplapin" — that's a kill by the player.

- Another kill: frame 24, maybe? Let's check.

Wait, let's list all kill feed entries where the killer is the player (the one in first-person).

1. Frame 19: Kill feed shows "Me" killed "Osamabincplapin" — so victim is Osamabincplapin.

2. Frame 22: Is there another kill? Let's check.

Wait, frame 21: The top-right kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — already counted.

Wait, maybe another kill. Let's check frame 29: The kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "swords" — so victim is swords.

Wait, let's go step by step through the frames.

Frame 1: Top-right kill feed: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast, not kill.

Frame 2: Kill feed: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so Evilv killed Takis.

Frame 3: Kill feed: "Evilv eliminated Takis" again? No, maybe frame 3 has another.

Frame 4: Kill feed: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — no.

Frame 5: Kill feed: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 6: Kill feed: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — again.

Wait, but the player is in first-person. The player's name is visible as "Me" in the top-right. When the player kills someone, the kill feed shows the player's name as the killer.

For example, when the player (first-person) shoots an enemy, the kill feed will have the player's name on the left, and the victim on the right.

Let's check the frames where the player is shooting:

Frame 0 to 2: The player is shooting, and the kill feed shows "Evilv eliminated Takis" — but maybe the player's name is Evilv.

Wait, the top-right corner has two teams. The player's team (top-left) has names, and the enemy team (top-right). The player's name is one of the names in the player's team.

In the first frame, the top-left shows "Me" (player's name) and others. Wait, the player's name is "Me", but in the game, it's their actual name.

Wait, let's look at the kill feed entries:

- Frame 17: "Me" [weapon icon] "Takis" — no, the kill feed says "Me eliminated Takis"? Wait, let's check frame 17: the kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — that would mean Me killed Takis.

- Frame 19: "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — Me killed Osamabincplapin.

- Frame 22: "Me" [weapon] "swords" — Me killed swords.

Wait, but in the first-person view, the player's name is "Me". When the player kills someone, the kill feed entry shows "Me" as the killer.

Let's check the frames:

- At frame 17, there's a kill feed entry: "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — victim Takis.

- Frame 19: "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — victim Osamabincplapin.

- Frame 22: "Me" [weapon] "swords" — victim swords.

Wait, but let's confirm each kill.

Looking at the game clip:

- At the beginning, the player (Me) shoots, and the kill feed shows "Me eliminated Takis" — so that's a kill.

- Then another kill: "Me eliminated Osamabincplapin".

- Then another kill: "Me eliminated swords".

Let's count:

1. Takis

2. Osamabincplapin

3. swords

Are there any others?

Check frame 1: The kill feed shows "Evilv eliminated Takis" — but is the player Evilv? Because in the top-right, the player's name is "Me", which is the player's name. Wait, maybe the player's name is Evilv. Let's check the top-right corner.

In the first frame, top-right: [Me] [weapon icon] [Takis] — but the player's name is listed as "Me", which is the player's in-game name. So when the player kills someone, the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer.

Wait, no. The kill feed entries have the killer's name on the left of the weapon icon, and the victim on the right. So if the player is "Me", then the kill feed entry would be "Me [weapon] [victim]".

Let's check the clip:

Frame 1: Kill feed entry "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so Evilv is killer, Takis is victim.

But the player is in first-person. If the player is Evilv, then that's their kill.

But how to tell? Let's look at the player's actions. The player is moving, shooting, and when they kill someone, the kill feed shows their name.

In frame 19, the kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — so the player's name is "Me" (as the in-game name). But in the top-right corner, the player's name is "Me".

Wait, maybe the player's name is "Me", and the kill feed entries where "Me" is the killer are the kills.

Let's check the kill feed entries:

- Frame 1: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — not the player's kill if player is Me.

- Frame 2: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — same.

- Frame 3: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — same.

- Frame 4: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — same.

- Frame 15: "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — kill.

Wait, in frame 15, the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer.

Wait, I need to check each frame's kill feed.

Looking at the provided frames:

Frame 0 (initial): Top-right kill feed: [Me] [weapon icon] [Takis] — no, the kill feed is the messages. Wait, the kill feed entries are the text that appears when a kill occurs.

For example, in the first few frames:

At frame 1: There's a kill feed entry "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so Evilv killed Takis.

Then, the player's name is "Me", but when the player kills, the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer.

Wait, the player is controlling the character in first-person. When they shoot and kill an enemy, the kill feed shows the player's name (their in-game name) on the left.

So let's find all kill feed entries where the killer is the player.

Looking at the frames:

- At frame 19: "Me eliminated Osamabincplapin" — kill.

- At frame 22: "Me eliminated swords" — kill.

- At frame 15: "Me eliminated Takis" — kill.

Wait, let's check frame 15:

Frame 15 (time 1:07):

The top-right kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — so Me (player) killed Takis.

Frame 19 (time 1:14):

Top-right kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — Me killed Osamabincplapin.

Frame 22 (time 1:19):

Top-right kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "swords" — Me killed swords.

Wait, but in frame 1, there's a kill feed entry "Evilv eliminated Takis" — but that's another player's kill. So if the player's name is Me, then their kills are when Me is the killer.

Wait, but the player's name is visible as "Me" in the top-right corner. So the kill feed entries where "Me" is the killer are the player's kills.

Let's confirm:

In frame 15, the kill feed says "Me eliminated Takis" — so victim is Takis.

In frame 19, "Me eliminated Osamabincplapin" — victim is Osamabincplapin.

In frame 22, "Me eliminated swords" — victim is swords.

Are there any other kills?

Frame 0: No kill feed entry.

Frame 1: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — not the player's kill.

Frame 2: No kill feed entry.

Frame 3: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — not the player's.

Frame 4: No kill feed.

Frame 5: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 6: "Evilv eliminated Takis" — not player's.

Frame 7: No.

Frame 8: No.

Frame 9: "Me eliminated Takis" — yes.

Frame 10: No.

Frame 11: No.

Frame 12: No.

Frame 13: No.

Frame 14: No.

Frame 15: "Me eliminated Takis" — yes.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the frames again.

Another way: when the player uses a knife, the kill feed might show it. In frame 27, there's a knife in the hand (first-person), so if they kill someone with a knife, the kill feed would have the knife icon.

Wait, the kill feed format: [killer] [weapon icon] [victim]

So for example, if the player uses a pistol, the weapon icon is the pistol, and the killer is the player's name.

In the first frame, the player is holding a rifle (Sova?), but then in frame 22, they switch to a knife.

Let's check the kill feed entries where the weapon icon is the player's weapon.

But maybe easier to look for the kill feed entries where the killer is "Me".

In the clip:

- At frame 15 (time 1:07), the kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — so victim Takis.

- At frame 19 (time 1:14), "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — victim Osamabincplapin.

- At frame 22 (time 1:19), "Me" [weapon] "swords" — victim swords.

Wait, but in frame 22, the victim is "swords".

Are these all the kills?

Let's check the game states:

At time 1:07 (frame 15), the player's HP is 100, but in the kill feed, it shows a kill.

Wait, in frame 19, the player's HP is 70 (after being shot), so that's a kill.

Let's list all kill feed entries with "Me" as the killer:

1. Me eliminated Takis (frame 15)

2. Me eliminated Osamabincplapin (frame 19)

3. Me eliminated swords (frame 22)

Wait, but is that three kills?

Wait, in frame 0, there's a broadcast: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

In frame 2, the kill feed says "Evilv eliminated Takis" — so that's a kill by Evilv.

But the player's name is "Me", so Evilv is a teammate.

Wait, the player's team has names, and the enemy team has names. The player's team is on the left (top), enemy on the right (top).

In frame 1, the top-left shows the player's team with names: Me, and others.

The kill feed entries where the killer is on the player's team (left) and the victim is on the enemy team (right).

So when the player (Me) kills an enemy, the kill feed shows "Me [weapon] [enemy name]".

Looking for those entries:

- At frame 15, the kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — Takis is an enemy (since Takis is in the enemy team? Wait, the enemy team is on the right. The top-right shows the enemy team.

Wait, in the top-right corner, the enemy team is listed with names like Takis, Osamabincplapin, swords.

So the player's team is top-left, enemy team top-right.

So when the player (Me) kills someone, the kill feed shows "Me [weapon] [enemy team name]".

Let's check the kill feed entries:

- Frame 15: "Me" [weapon] "Takis" — Takis is an enemy team name, so that's a kill.

- Frame 19: "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincplapin" — Osamabincplapin is enemy, kill.

- Frame 22: "Me" [weapon] "swords" — swords is enemy, kill.

Are there any other kills?

Frame 29: The kill feed shows "swords" as the killer, so swords eliminated someone — but that's not the player.

So the player's kills are three: Takis, Osamabincplapin, swords.

Wait, but let's check the first frame. The player's team is "Me" and others. The enemy team is "Takis", "Osamabincplapin", "swords".

When the player kills Takis, the kill feed shows "Me" [weapon] "Takis".

Similarly for the others.

Wait, in frame 1, the kill feed shows "Evilv eliminated Takis" — Evilv is a teammate (since Evilv is in the player's team?), so that's a teammate killing the enemy.

But the player's kills are when the player (Me) is the killer.

So the kill feed entries where the killer is "Me" are:

1. Takis

2. Osamabincplapin

3. swords

Total of 3 kills.
</think>

PLAYER NAME: Me  
KILLS:  
1. Takis  
2. Osamabincplapin  
3. swords  
TOTAL: 3
